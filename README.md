Selenium and BeautifulSoup for Web Scraping - README

This README provides an overview and usage instructions for using Selenium and BeautifulSoup together for web scraping.

Overview
Selenium is a popular automation testing tool that allows you to control a web browser and interact with web pages programmatically. It's commonly used for tasks like automating UI tests or scraping websites that heavily rely on JavaScript to render content dynamically.

BeautifulSoup is a Python library used for parsing HTML and XML documents. It provides a convenient way to navigate, search, and extract data from HTML pages.

Combining Selenium and BeautifulSoup allows you to leverage Selenium's browser automation capabilities to fetch web pages with dynamic content and then use BeautifulSoup to parse and extract data from the fetched pages.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

Python: Install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/) if you haven't already.

Selenium: Install Selenium using pip with the following command:

Copy code
pip install selenium
BeautifulSoup: Install BeautifulSoup using pip with the following command:

Copy code
pip install beautifulsoup4
Chrome WebDriver: For Selenium to work, you need to download the Chrome WebDriver corresponding to your Chrome browser version and place it in your system's PATH. You can download the Chrome WebDriver from here: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

Usage
Import the required libraries:

python
Copy code
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
Set up the Chrome WebDriver:

python
Copy code
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
Fetch the web page using Selenium:

python
Copy code
url = "https://example.com"
driver.get(url)
Wait for the page to load and JavaScript content to be rendered (if required):

python
Copy code
import time
time.sleep(5)  # Waits for 5 seconds
Get the page source with the rendered content:

python
Copy code
page_source = driver.page_source
Close the WebDriver:

python
Copy code
driver.quit()
Parse the HTML content with BeautifulSoup:

python
Copy code
soup = BeautifulSoup(page_source, "html.parser")
